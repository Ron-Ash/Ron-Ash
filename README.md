### Hi, I'm Ron 👋
I'm a final year Computer Science student at UQ. Fascinated by all things Machine Learning, Data Science, Cryptography, and Math.
Experimenting with applying the concepts I'm learning in and out of the university.
Looking to apply and expand my knowledge in the field of machine learning and data science.

  💞️ I'm looking for part time internship in machine learning, data science, or AI while I finish my degree <br>
